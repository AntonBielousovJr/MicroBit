We made a function that would take an input from the rotary angle sensor and transform it into a working variable for the volume as well as a variable for our bass (vibration mmotor) that would change the frequency of it to also match the volume. The buttons that are on the microbit give the user to turn bass on or off.

Depending on what the volume is a different amount of LEDs will be lit up

We created a forever loop to play the song Jingle bells as well as make the motor vibrate on certain beats to give it "bass"
